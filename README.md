# Texthooker UI

A web interface for using websocket-based interfaces, such as:
- [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) with [textractor-websocket](https://github.com/sadolit/textractor-websocket) or [TextractorSender](https://github.com/KamWithK/TextractorSender)
- [mpv](https://mpv.io) with [mpv_websocket](https://github.com/kuroahna/mpv_websocket)

An online version of the page can be accessed [here](https://renji-xd.github.io/texthooker-ui/).

An offline version of the page can be downloaded from the [docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Renji-XD/texthooker-ui/main/docs/index.html) folder or build locally by your own.

## Building

```
# Install pnpm
npm install --global pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the Page
pnpm run build

# Optional - serve the Page via local Server
pnpm run preview
```

The page can be opened via the index.html inside the "docs" folder and is usable without the need of hosting it via a server.

## FAQ

### I can't connect to the websocket with textractor-websocket.

-   This plugin requires that textractor captures at least one line before starting the server - connect manually afterwards

### I can't connect to the websocket with TextractorSender.

-   Make sure you are using the right port which is 9001

### I can't connect to the websocket with a different plugin/still can't connect to the websocket with one of the mentioned plugins.

-   Make sure your firewall is not blocking the required ports. You can also check if another extension is interfering by trying out the page with a clean temporary profile and disabled extensions
-	**For Brave Users**: If you are using a hosted / online version of the page disable the brave shield for the domain to allow the usage of unsafe websocket connections. Alternatively try out the local / offline version which you can find in the [docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Renji-XD/texthooker-ui/main/docs/index.html) folder

### Can I use this page with extensions like [Clipboard Inserter](https://github.com/kmltml/clipboard-inserter) or [lap-clipboard-inserter](https://github.com/laplus-sadness/lap-clipboard-inserter)?

-   When "Enable external Clipboard Monitor" is checked text appended as paragraph to the page body will be taken over by the app. Make sure to enable this setting before the actual extension to avoid wrongly pasted elements

## Known Issues

-   High number of displayed characters may slow down the page performance due to the current greedy way of counting characters etc.
-   The horizontal reading mode performs overall better than the vertical one
-   Line breaks added manually during editing a line are sometimes removed
-	The page was build with desktop usage in mind - following guides (e. g. like [this](https://rentry.co/android-texthook) one) to access the page via tablet or mobile devices may have a limited user experience or functionality
